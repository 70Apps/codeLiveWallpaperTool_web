# Google Phone (Pixel) Screen Sizes — 2024 / 2025 / 2026

This reference summarizes commonly-used Google Pixel phone display pixel canvases across 2024–2026 model years. Values are practical canvas sizes for wallpaper and export workflows; they are approximate — verify against the exact device when precise fidelity is required.

## How to use these numbers

- Values are shown as width × height in portrait orientation. Swap numbers for landscape wallpapers.
- Prefer exporting at the listed canvas size for pixel-perfect wallpapers; use center-crop to keep focal points within safe areas.
- Pixel canvases can vary slightly by model, carrier or panel vendor; treat these as designer/export targets rather than guaranteed specs.
