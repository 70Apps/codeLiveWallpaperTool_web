# Apple Watch Screen Size — 2026 Annual Update

This post provides a concise reference of Apple Watch case sizes and commonly-used pixel dimensions for wallpaper and watch face asset preparation. Values are shown in portrait orientation (width × height). For landscape use, swap the values.

## 2026 Apple Watch reference sizes

> These pixel dimensions are intended as a practical canvas reference for designers and wallpaper exporters. Some device generations share the same display sizes; always verify against the physical device when exact fidelity is required.

| Device / Family | Case Size | Pixels (px, portrait) | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Apple Watch Series 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 (newer larger displays) | 45 mm | 396 x 484 | Common for modern 45mm models (landscape 484×396)
| Apple Watch Series 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 (newer smaller displays) | 41 mm | 352 x 430 | Common for modern 41mm models (landscape 430×352)
| Apple Watch Series 4 / 5 / 6 / SE (earlier 40/44mm) | 44 mm | 368 x 448 | Used in many 44mm models (landscape 448×368)
| Apple Watch Series 4 / 5 / 6 / SE (earlier 38/40mm) | 40 mm | 324 x 394 | Used in many older 40mm models (landscape 394×324)
| Apple Watch Ultra (49 mm) | 49 mm | 410 x 502 (approx.) | Ultra variants use larger displays; value shown as approximate — verify for Ultra-specific models

## Notes and recommendations

- Pixel values are presented as width × height in portrait orientation. Swap for landscape wallpaper assets.
- Use center-crop strategies when creating watch wallpapers so important content remains visible within round/square watch face cutouts.
- For best quality, export wallpapers at the device pixel dimensions listed above. When supporting multiple watches, include the largest practical size and derive smaller assets by downscaling.
