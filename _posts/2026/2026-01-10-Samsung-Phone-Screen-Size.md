# Samsung Phone Screen Sizes — 2024 / 2025 / 2026

This reference summarizes commonly-used Samsung phone display pixel canvases across 2024–2026 model years. Values are practical canvas sizes for wallpaper and export workflows; treat them as approximate and verify against the exact device when precise pixel fidelity is required.

## How to use these numbers

- Values are shown as width × height in portrait orientation. Swap numbers for landscape wallpapers.
- Use the listed pixel canvases as the export target for wallpapers; prefer center-crop to keep focal areas inside visible safe regions.
- These are practical references; some Samsung variants (carrier/custom panels) may differ slightly.
